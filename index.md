## Overview
This AUV is heavy. In order to move smoothly and quickly through the water, it's six thrusters must have sufficient propulsion strength. The AUV also contains a full embedded computer system running dual-core CPUs and a variety of sensors and actuators. And being "autonomous" means that it must run untethered to an external power supply. Thus, a hefty battery power system was required.

## Hardware
Lithium-polymer batteries were selected because of their superior energy density, allowing the most runtime with minimal size and weight.

* 6-cell, 24V parallel orientation with 2 packs
* Charging, discharging
* Care and maintenance for LiPo batteries
